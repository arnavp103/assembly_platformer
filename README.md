 # Drive to Survive 
This is a fun endless platformer where your objective is to rack up as high a score as possible. 


If you have MARS you can run it with the settings included at the top of the file.

Use wasd to control the car and collect jerry cans to increase your score while avoiding bombs and falling to your death.
